$FTAI - RBC Research Note
Our view: Among the recent FTAI announcements (3rd PMA part approval, FTAI Power launch, SCI upside), the recent CFM International partnership is perhaps the most strategically significant. We believe FTAI is now
positioned to exceed prior CFM56 expectations in terms of both revenues and margins, and the company should now be viewed as the leading non-OEM player in the CFM56 aftermarket. We are adjusting our 4Q25 estimates (lower lease contribution) and factoring in $450M to our 2027 adj. EBITDA to reflect the FTAI Power contribution. We are increasing our PT to $350 (from $270), maintaining OP rating.

Upside scenario
Our upside scenario models better-than-expected growth in module sales, stronger PMA adoption, and upside to our estimates within the aeroderivative business for both volume and margins. We assume revenues of $5.5B with adj. EBITDA margins of 44.8% in 2027E. We then assume further multiple appreciation and assign a 19.3x, resulting in a $430 upside scenario.
