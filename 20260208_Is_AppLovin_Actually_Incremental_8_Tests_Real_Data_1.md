# Summary

The podcast explores the performance and tactical application of AppLovin as an advertising platform for e-commerce businesses. It highlights the positive incrementality observed across multiple tests, where AppLovin's internal measurements consistently underestimate the actual revenue impact. The discussion covers best practices for account setup, emphasizing the ease of integration with Shopify due to its in-depth pixel tracking. Speakers also delve into campaign structure, creative strategies, and bidding options, noting the platform's unique feature of guaranteed ad exposure through longer, unskippable video ads within mobile games. The hosts predict a significant increase in investment in AppLovin for the coming year, potentially making it a major player alongside Meta and Google Ads.

# Takeaways

* AppLovin's measurement of business impact is conservative due to its exclusive use of sharp, click-based attribution (one-day or same-day).
* Incrementality tests on AppLovin consistently show positive business impact, with revenue impact exceeding platform-reported impact.
* AppLovin's Shopify integration simplifies account setup, pixel firing, server events, and feed integration, often achievable within 10 minutes.
* A consolidated campaign structure is optimal for new AppLovin accounts during the initial 14-day learning period.
* Utilizing 30+ second video ads on AppLovin is advantageous because the platform guarantees a minimum of 10 seconds watch time.
* AppLovin's algorithm favors ad creative videos with a median exposure of 35 seconds.
* Applying the average incrementality factor (e.g., 151%) to a client's AMER target ROAS can inform bid settings on AppLovin.
* AppLovin's prospecting campaign, which focuses on new customer acquisition, has demonstrated a 3x increase in new customer traffic, as measured by Northbeam.
* AppLovin's share of total media investment for Black Friday and Cyber Monday is predicted to increase from under 5% to 15-20% in 2026.
* The peak investment in AppLovin during Black Friday/Cyber Monday occurred on Monday rather than Friday, indicating its performance and ability to absorb media dollars quickly.

# Q & A

**Q: What makes AppLovin an exciting channel for e-commerce advertisers, and what results have you seen from incrementality tests?**

A: AppLovin stands out as a particularly exciting channel, especially with the introduction of its self-service portal. We've conducted approximately eight completed incrementality tests, and every new project starts with one. The consistent finding is that AppLovin measures as positively incremental. The platform's conservative measurement, using only sharp, click-based attribution (either one-day or same-day), means that the actual business impact is often larger than what the platform reports—typically showing incrementality percentages between 120% and 150%.

---

**Q: How should advertisers approach creative strategy on AppLovin, given its unique ad format within mobile games?**

A: Given that AppLovin serves ads within mobile games with a guaranteed minimum of 10 seconds watch time, advertisers should prioritize longer, engaging video content. There's no way to click out of the ads, so there's no benefit to not using 30+ second videos. This provides a unique canvas to work with, allowing for more creative storytelling and the opportunity to hook viewers beyond the initial few seconds, unlike scrolly social media where attention spans are shorter.

---

**Q: How does AppLovin's measurement compare to other platforms like Meta and YouTube, and what does this imply for advertiser confidence?**

A: AppLovin's incrementality measurements have shown a tight band of results across tests, similar to Meta's 7-Day Click attribution, which gives us a higher level of confidence. In contrast, YouTube incrementality tests often yield wider bands, making it more challenging to have confidence in the results. The consistent measurement from AppLovin leads to an ever-increasing level of confidence that we can be confident that we're helping create contribution margin with this investment.

---

**Q: What are some best practices for account setup on AppLovin, particularly for Shopify stores?**

A: Setting up an AppLovin account for a Shopify store is remarkably simple. By installing the Shopify app, the pixel and server events are automatically fired, and the product feed is pulled directly from the Shopify store into AppLovin. The entire setup process can take as little as 10 minutes. However, for non-Shopify stores, the setup is more technically involved, requiring more resources from a developer standpoint to trigger all the necessary events.

---

**Q: How should advertisers think about campaign structure on AppLovin, specifically regarding consolidation versus segmentation?**

A: When starting a new account on AppLovin, it's best to begin with one consolidated campaign to ramp up through the learning period and apply the incrementality test. After that, consider segmenting campaigns based on factors like Average Order Value (AOV) to ensure spend is directed towards higher-value products. Since bidding is set at the campaign level, AOV becomes a key trigger for segmentation.

---

**Q: What bidding options are available on AppLovin, and how should advertisers approach them?**

A: AppLovin initially offered only Cost Per Purchase (CPP) bidding but has since added Target ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) bidding and a new customer acquisition bidding option. While both CPP and ROAS bidding are viable, I've seen a little bit more efficiency and scale from Target ROAS. It's also worth exploring the prospecting campaign type with the new customer acquisition bidding, especially for larger clients with significant customer files.

---

**Q: How can advertisers leverage AppLovin's prospecting campaign and new customer acquisition bidding?**

A: We demoed the prospecting function in AppLovin, and we saw like a 3x increase in the North Beam percent new customer traffic. The prospecting campaign, combined with new customer acquisition bidding, can be highly effective in reaching net new eyeballs. This is particularly valuable for brands with large existing customer files, where it's crucial to focus on acquiring new customers rather than retargeting existing ones.

---

**Q: What is the significance of AppLovin's pixel, and how does it contribute to effective advertising?**

A: AppLovin's pixel is quite in-depth, tracking a large number of events, including page view, view content, add to cart, payment info, checkout, and purchase. This richer data set allows the pixel to find the right audience more effectively. All those events help that pixel find the right audience.

---

**Q: What is your prediction for AppLovin's role in e-commerce media investment in the coming years?**

A: I predict that we're going to see material investment into this channel for our clients in 2026. During Black Friday, Cyber Monday, it turned out to be the third largest investment out of all the channels that we run for our clients over that period. My prediction for this coming year, in 2026, is that AppLovin is going to be 15%, 20% of the total investment in Black Friday and Cyber Monday.

---

**Q: What key factors contributed to AppLovin's success during Black Friday and Cyber Monday?**

A: AppLovin's success during Black Friday and Cyber Monday was driven by its ability to deploy a lot of media dollars really fast due to the high volume of available impressions and its performant nature. The media dollars actually flowed into AppLovin towards the end of that period, which is an incredible signal.

---

**Q: What makes AppLovin different from other platforms like YouTube in terms of advertising performance and measurement?**

A: Unlike YouTube, where incrementality bands are wider and measurement is more uncertain, AppLovin provides more consistent and reliable measurements. This makes it easier to have confidence in the platform's performance and justify increased investment.

---

**Q: What are the limitations of creative sets in AppLovin?**

A: For each creative set, we're allowed 10 videos, 10 images. So we're uploading as many as we can. Let's say we have 10 videos, 10 images. And then, you know, kind of AppLovin system algorithm is figuring out which combination of those is working the best and then showing that those more consistently.

---

**Q: What is the significance of the 10-second watch time guaranteed on every ad in AppLovin?**

A: With a ten-second window in which you are sort of guaranteed eyeballs, more or less, you have opportunities to hook. Now you have the first 10 seconds to give yourself sort of more chances at making that hook land.

---

**Q: How does AppLovin's approach to cost controls compare to other advertising platforms?**

A: AppLovin started with a focus on cost controls, initially offering only Cost Per Purchase (CPP) bidding. This reflects a deliberate approach to building the platform with the best controls in mind, ensuring that advertisers have efficiency-based bidding options.

---

**Q: What features are advertisers requesting from AppLovin, and how might this shape the platform's future?**

A: Advertisers are requesting features like the ability to set bids at the ad set level and schedule creative start and stop times at the ad set level. These requests reflect a desire for more granular control and customization, which could influence the platform's development trajectory.

---

**Q: What is the current average incrementality factor being observed on AppLovin, and how does it influence spending decisions?**

A: If we take out that one outlier that we had about a week ago, we're averaging slightly above 151% for all the tests that have come back so far. We have a tight average of those incrementality results coming in around the same score, which we can feel confident about driving a lot of spend behind.

---

**Q: What is the difference between universal and prospecting campaigns on AppLovin?**

A: Universal campaigns include existing customers as well as prospecting, while prospecting campaigns are just prospecting.

---

**Q: How are you determining the target ROAS to set in AppLovin?**

A: I'm taking our client's AMER target, and then I'm applying the average incrementality factor that we have of 151%. You know, then I'm getting a platform for me to set in AppLovin, and then I'm pushing as much spend to that as possible.

Richard Gaffin introduces Tony Chopp and Connor McLaughlin to discuss AppLovin, focusing on incrementality and tactical learnings. The conversation will cover updates on the platform's incrementality and practical insights gained from using AppLovin across multiple clients. They transition from speculation and testing to real-world application, aiming to share on-the-ground feedback and best practices.

---

## AppLovin's Positive Incrementality Test Results and Conservative Measurement
[(02:27)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=147)
Tony Chopp highlights AppLovin as an exciting channel, emphasizing positive incrementality results from eight completed tests. These tests compare the platform's reported business impact to actual revenue impact, consistently showing a larger impact on revenue (e.g., 1.2 to 1.5 times higher). The platform's measurement is conservative due to its use of sharp, click-based attribution with either one-day or same-day windows.

---

## Consistency in Incrementality Measurement and Confidence in AppLovin
[(05:17)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=317)
The incrementality percentage measurements for AppLovin have been consistently in a tight band, around 120% to 150%, increasing confidence in the platform's impact. This consistency contrasts with platforms like YouTube, which show wider incrementality bands. The repeatable nature of these results across different accounts increases confidence in AppLovin's ability to contribute to contribution margin.

---

## Transitioning from Experimentation to Application: Tactical Elements of AppLovin
[(08:36)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=516)
The discussion shifts from the science of incrementality testing to the practical application of AppLovin. It was the third biggest spending channel over the holidays. The focus turns to tactical elements and initial learnings about what works best on the platform. Tony sets the stage by explaining AppLovin's transition from a full-service advertising channel to a self-serve platform in October of last year.

This is an advertisement for TaxCloud.

---

## AppLovin Account Setup Simplicity for Shopify Stores
[(12:43)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=763)
The discussion breaks down into account setup, structure, bidding, and creative. Account setup for Shopify stores is highlighted as simple, involving installing the Shopify app to fire the pixel, server events, and pull the feed into AppLovin, taking about 10 minutes. The AppLovin pixel is in-depth, tracking numerous events, which is theorized to help the pixel find the right audience.

---

## Campaign Structure: Consolidation vs. Segmentation on AppLovin
[(15:42)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=942)
The conversation shifts to campaign structure, addressing consolidation versus segmentation. Initially, a consolidated campaign is recommended for the first 14 days to ramp up and gather initial learnings. Segmentation is then considered based on factors like AOV (Average Order Value), especially since bidding is set at the campaign level. The reason to segment is because a different bid is needed.

---

## Cost Controls and Bidding Options on AppLovin
[(17:37)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1057)
The discussion covers cost controls on AppLovin, which initially only offered cost per purchase bidding. Later, ROAS (Return on Ad Spend) bidding was added. The platform started with the best controls, using zero-day click attribution and cost per purchase optimization. The platform's evolution involves balancing simplicity with advertisers' desires for more granular control.

---

## AppLovin's Creative Set Structure and Algorithm
[(19:21)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1161)
The conversation continues about the tension between the simple thing that was built and the advertisers' desires. The discussion goes one level deeper into how ad sets are being thought about. Creative sets are tested by product, with each set allowing 10 videos and 10 images. The AppLovin algorithm determines the best combination of these assets to show more consistently.

---

## Creative Strategy: Leveraging AppLovin's Longer Ad Exposure Times
[(21:20)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1280)
AppLovin has a median exposure time of 35 seconds for ad creative videos, with a minimum guaranteed watch time of 10 seconds. This longer exposure time influences creative strategy, favoring longer 9x16 videos in the 40-second to one-minute range. The guaranteed 10-second watch time provides more opportunities to hook viewers, increasing the chances of a high-performing ad.

---

## Creative Opportunities and Bidding Options on AppLovin
[(24:26)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1466)
The longer exposure time on AppLovin provides a larger canvas for creative expression compared to scrolly social media. The discussion transitions to bidding, covering cost per purchase, ROAS bidding, and new customer acquisition bidding. While both cost per purchase and target ROAS bidding are being tested, there is a slight lean towards target ROAS for efficiency and scale.

---

## Prospecting Campaigns and New Customer Acquisition on AppLovin
[(27:08)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1628)
An experience using a prospecting campaign with Northbeam showed a 3x increase in new customer traffic. The new customer acquisition function in AppLovin appears effective in reaching net new eyeballs. The platform provides tools that help performance marketers balance efficiency goals with the need to reach new audiences.

---

## Incrementality Tests and Future Predictions for AppLovin
[(30:11)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1811)
Most incrementality tests, averaging around 151%, use the universal campaign. A new client is running prospecting only from the start, and an incrementality test will be run. There is a bet that the prospecting bidding will have an incrementality readout that's higher than the ones done so far. Tony predicts material investment into AppLovin in 2026.

---

## AppLovin's Performance During Black Friday and Cyber Monday
[(31:23)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1883)
AppLovin was the third-largest investment channel during Black Friday and Cyber Monday. The investment curve peaked on Monday, indicating the ability to deploy media dollars quickly and effectively. While AppLovin represented a small portion of the total investment for the weekend (less than 5%), the prediction is that it will be 15% to 20% in 2026.

---

## AppLovin as the Third Platform and Call to Action
[(33:58)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2038)
AppLovin is emerging as the third platform, and it's time to get on board. If running an e-commerce brand, the recommendation is to make AppLovin 20% of the media investment this year.

# Transcript

**Speaker 1:**
[(00:00)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=0)
I'm just going to set the table with, like, I'm having so much fun with this platform. Like, you know, testing out all different kinds of creative, whether that's, you know,  content creator videos, that's still images, that's UGC street interviews, you know, we're testing it all out right now. And like,  I think one of the best things about AppLovin is that we're re-utilizing creative that we're already using in other places. I'm seeing in Slack channels, all image and videos for other channels. I'm like, I'm going to grab that. I'll take that. I'll test that for AppLovin. You know, so everything's super excited right now or super exciting right now.

[(00:43)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=43)
And I think we're still trying to like figuring out what exactly type of content works the best,  but we're seeing really positive results kind of like in all areas right now in terms of the creative itself.

[(01:31)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=91)
I'm your host, Richard Gaffin, Director of Digital Product Strategy here at Common Thread Collective. And I'm joined today, in fact, in person by Mr. Tony Chopp. Tony, reach your hand out over here. Oh, there it is. See? Proof we're in the same room. Tony's joining us here to talk a little bit more about a topic that we've touched on many times on this podcast,  but that is AppLovin. And we're joined also by one of our paid media managers, Connor McLaughlin,  who's been kind of our I'm an expert here on AppLovin over the last few months as we've been really scaling that channel. So,

[(02:03)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=123)
 what we're going to talk about today is a little bit of an update on kind of some of the conversations we've been having around the incrementality of the platform. And then, Conor and Tony are going to jump straight into some of the more tactical stuff that we've learned. In the past, we've been talking in terms of speculation, in terms of tests. Now, we've actually been using AppLovin across probably almost 10 clients. And we have a lot more kind of learnings and on-the-ground feedback for you guys to talk through. So let's start off with that kind of incrementality discussion around maybe recapping for us,  Tony, some of the tests we've run in the past and kind of where we're at now.

**Tony:**
[(02:36)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=156)
Yeah.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(02:37)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=157)
Oh, hi, Richard.

**Tony:**
[(02:38)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=158)
Happy to be here.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(02:39)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=159)
Thank you.

**Speaker 3:**
[(02:40)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=160)
By the way, I had the.

**Tony:**
[(02:42)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=162)
I'm Tony Chopp.

**Speaker 3:**
[(02:42)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=162)
I'm the host of the Ecommerce Playbook podcast last week while you were out.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(02:45)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=165)
Yeah, how did that feel?

**Speaker 1:**
[(02:47)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=167)
Pretty good.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(02:47)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=167)
Feels pretty good. Cool, we'll take it away.

**Tony:**
[(02:50)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=170)
Yeah, happy new year.

**Speaker 3:**
[(02:51)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=171)
So yeah, AppLovin remains like one of the most exciting like channel,  like new channel entrances that I've ever seen in my 20-year career doing this. So to your point, like last year it was really Oh man, this is blowing up so fast. Is it good, I guess, is the question that all media people start to ask and we ask and answer that question through incrementality testings. We started putting the channel through its paces halfway through last year and then really accelerated that in October of last year when AppLovin opened up their self-service portal. We were one of the early partners to be able to onboard some clients into that.

**Tony:**
[(03:39)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=219)
So we're up to.

**Speaker 3:**
[(03:42)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=222)
Approximately eight completed incrementality tests on the channel and every new project that we start we start with an incrementality test. The common thread, if you will, through all of them has been incrementality measures that come back as positively incremental. So what does that mean?

**Tony:**
[(04:04)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=244)
When we do an incrementality test, we measure what the platform tells us the business impact is versus the impact on revenue.

**Speaker 3:**
[(04:10)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=250)
We just compare those two things and we're looking for a difference. Every time we measure AppLovin, the platform tells us the business impact is 1 to 1,  and then we go look at revenue, the business impact is larger, 1.2, 1.5, whatever it is. Every single one of the tests has come back positive. And the takeaway from this is the The measurement,  if you're going to look in the AppLovin platform,  I think maybe we should start calling it Axon now.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(04:45)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=285)
They rebranded it.

**Speaker 1:**
[(04:46)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=286)
Yeah.

**Speaker 3:**
[(04:48)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=288)
AppLovin slash Axon. The measurement in the platform is going to be conservative. It makes sense, sort of, if you think about it. I think one of the things that they did when they launched the platform to e-commerce advertisers that I think was really smart is they only use really sharp attribution. So there's no view attribution setting available in the platform. It's only click attribution.

**Tony:**
[(05:17)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=317)
And to make it even sharper.

**Speaker 3:**
[(05:20)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=320)
Kind of keep me honest here. It's either one day or zero day, like same day.

**Unknown Speaker:**
[(05:27)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=327)
Yeah, like attribution.

**Tony:**
[(05:29)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=329)
So if you think about it, that's like as sharp of an attribution window as you could possibly use to measure the impact of the ads. And therefore, it makes pretty logical sense that the actual business impact is larger, a.k.a.

**Speaker 3:**
[(05:46)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=346)
this theme of every incrementality test that we've done so far indicates positive business impact. So in another thing that's that I think up until recently,  is we got one test back recently that had a really large positive incrementality factor,  which kind of throws us for a little bit of a loop, even though it's positive,  it's really, really large.

**Tony:**
[(06:10)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=370)
Up until that test,  the other thing that was Fairly consistent about all of the prior tests is the incrementality percentage measurement for all of them was in a pretty tight band.

**Speaker 3:**
[(06:26)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=386)
120% incremental, 130% incremental, 150% incremental.

**Tony:**
[(06:32)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=392)
So when the band is really tight like that,  it It leads to a higher level of confidence that your measurement is correlating to business impact in a really consistent way.

**Speaker 3:**
[(06:46)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=406)
We see this from all the incrementality tests that we run on Meta, 7-Day Click. It's 120%, 115%, 125%. They all sort of cluster in this really tight band. I'll give you an alternate universe that's more challenging, which is YouTube. When we do incrementality tests on YouTube, we get these really wide bands. Sometimes it's really, really incremental. Sometimes it's the opposite of that. Those things just lead us to have a lower level of confidence, and ultimately,  we need to ask and answer more questions.

**Tony:**
[(07:22)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=442)
I'm curious, what would you add, subtract from any of that, from what you've seen?

**Speaker 1:**
[(07:29)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=449)
Yeah, no, I think just to touch a little bit more on the incrementality percent averages that we're seeing,  if we take out that one outlier that we had about a week ago,  we're averaging slightly above 151% for all the tests that have come back so far. So like you said, it's kind of like, it's a great recipe for success. We have a tight average of those incrementality results coming in around the same score,  which we can feel confident about driving a lot of spend behind.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(07:58)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=478)
So the indicator is basically here. What we've learned is that AppLovin is consistent in how it performs, how it reports,  and it's erring on the side of being conservative,  which is generally the side you want a platform to err on.

**Speaker 3:**
[(08:14)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=494)
Like in the scientific method of your hypothesis or your experiment being repeatable,  I think that's maybe a decent metaphor for what it feels like to be running media at an agency for a bunch of different accounts and getting really consistent measurement out of a channel. It leads to a higher, ever-increasing level of confidence that we can be Be confident that we're helping create contribution margin with this investment.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(08:48)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=528)
Yeah, so part of what we're talking about then today is the transition from, let's say, science to application, right? We've been running the experiment. We have a high level of confidence in this platform,  and now we've been actually putting it to work for us. Now, I know, Tony, maybe you're going to talk about this a little bit later,  but it was our third biggest spending channel over the holidays, which is meaningful. Like, as you said, this is kind of the biggest explosion onto the scene of a platform that we've seen in a long time. But since we've actually been now running AppLovin for a number of clients.

[(09:16)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=556)
We've actually been in the day to day outside of just the test sort of lab environment. What we want to talk to you now then is like some of the more tactical elements of this, right? Like what are, as far as we can tell, Best Practices. Now, I guess we don't necessarily want to put our stamp on any of these because it's early,  but some initial kind of learnings about what tactically works best on this platform. So, I'll turn it over. Conor, you can kind of start off there,  maybe give us some context about your work with this platform so far.

**Speaker 3:**
[(09:45)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=585)
Just real quick, Conor, before you go, I just want to kind of set the table. So, when AppLovin first came onto the scene in At the end of 2024,  they invited some advertisers to join the platform and they We're functioning as a full-service advertising channel to where they had a squad of people that was actually doing the media buying campaign setup and everything on the platform.

**Tony:**
[(10:11)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=611)
So that changed in October of last year.

**Speaker 3:**
[(10:13)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=613)
When I say the platform became self-serve or opened up to self-serve,  essentially what that means is they opened up an opportunity for us to bring our clients in and actually do the campaign setup,  the media buying, etc.

**Tony:**
[(10:29)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=629)
And so as that happened, the amount of opportunity that we had to work in the platform,  touch the buttons, pull the levers, has increased. And enter Kana, because we've gotten an opportunity to put more hands on it. I needed more hands. And so that's sort of the genesis of how the AppLovin squad at CTC is growing. And as a function of that, we've actually had the opportunity, both Kana and myself,  to actually build accounts from start to finish, from creating an account, get the pixels and feeds wired up,  build campaigns and optimize them. So Kana, you got a bunch of stuff going on in here. Hit us, brother. What's standing out?

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(11:14)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=674)
Here's the thing. Every minute spent worrying about sales tax is a minute that could have been spent on your customers,  your product, your brand, and growing your business. That's why so many Shopify brands work with TaxCloud. They take the complexity out of sales tech by handling registrations, filings, and compliance directly with the states. No complex setup. No waiting days for support. Just a trusted partner who gets it right and gives you time back to focus on what really matters. Get back to running your business. Visit taxcloud.com slash thread. That's taxcloud.com slash thread.

**Speaker 1:**
[(11:46)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=706)
Yeah, I think I'm just gonna set the table with, like, I'm having so much fun with this platform. Like, you know, testing out all different kinds of creative, whether that's, you know,  content creator videos, that's still images, that's UGC street interviews, you know, we're testing it all out right now. And like,  I think one of the best things about AppLovin is that we're re-utilizing creative that we're already using in other places. I'm seeing in Slack channels all the image and videos for other channels. I'm like, I'm going to grab that. I'll take that. I'll test that for AppLovin. You know,

[(12:27)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=747)
 so everything's super excited right now or super exciting right now and I think we're still trying to like figuring out what exactly type of content works the best but we're seeing really positive results kind of like in all areas right now in terms of the creative itself.

**Tony:**
[(12:43)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=763)
So let me kind of break this down in a section.

**Speaker 3:**
[(12:46)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=766)
So let's start with like, these are the ones that come to mind. Account setup, like out of the gate.

**Tony:**
[(12:51)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=771)
And then I want to talk a little bit about structure. And I want to talk a little bit about bidding.

**Speaker 3:**
[(12:57)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=777)
And then I want to talk a little bit about creative. And then I just have a random question about sort of end cards and like that, like little nuance.

**Tony:**
[(13:05)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=785)
But so for step zero, account setup, one of the things that has stood out to me is if Shopify store account setup is magically simple. So fire up the Axon account, install the Shopify app,  and the Shopify app fires the pixel and the server events and pulls the feed out of the Shopify store into AppLovin,  the whole setup process is If you have all the permissions right, 10 minutes. And I think that's like,  as a person who gets involved in like some of the infrastructure projects throughout the agency and like getting all the wires wired up,  I'm very, very, it's like enjoyable to set up an AppLovin account if you're Shopify brand.

**Speaker 3:**
[(13:55)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=835)
But I'm curious if you have any thoughts about that.

**Speaker 1:**
[(13:59)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=839)
No, totally, absolutely love it. I mean, we can get, essentially get everything together and started like on the same day, which is super exciting. And like, that's just the, like, that's the day zero period, uploading all that creative, doing the pixel and Shopify. And then, you know, after that we'll have initial learnings and like that and results in that three to five day range.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(14:21)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=861)
Let's quickly say you're not on Shopify. What's the situation there? It's just more of a hassle or it's not even available?

**Tony:**
[(14:27)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=867)
No, it's available.

**Speaker 3:**
[(14:28)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=868)
I'm doing one right now for a site that's on a custom backend.

**Tony:**
[(14:32)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=872)
It's definitely more technically involved. One of the things that stood out to me when I did the Shopify setup is the pixels are pretty in-depth.

**Speaker 3:**
[(14:43)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=883)
Mattis, can Pixel fires like, I don't know, six or eight like standard events,  you know, page view, view content, add to cart, payment info, checkout, purchase. There's a couple others that you can add. The number of events that the AppLovin Pixel is looking at is super long.

**Tony:**
[(15:03)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=903)
And so I have a theory that I haven't really.

**Speaker 3:**
[(15:07)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=907)
I'm kind of a data and signal guy when I think about what it means to be successful in advertising,  and I think one of the Axon AppLovin advantages is actually the pixel is really deep,  and it looks at a lot of events.

**Tony:**
[(15:21)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=921)
All that to say, to answer your question, Richard, The Shopify install is really quick.

**Speaker 3:**
[(15:27)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=927)
The non-Shopify install is requiring more resources from a developer standpoint. The reason why is because of all these events that we're having to trigger. And the story I make up is that all those events help that pixel find the right audience.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(15:42)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=942)
Well yeah, it sounds like a richer data set, potentially, for this platform. But okay, let's kind of roll from the setup piece into the actual operation.

**Tony:**
[(15:51)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=951)
All right, so yeah, so setup, cool, easy Shopify. Now let's just talk about campaign structure. So the age-old debate, consolidation versus segmentation. Hit me.

**Speaker 1:**
[(16:04)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=964)
Yeah, what I'm learning so far is, you know,  right now when we're starting off like a hot new fresh account,  we want to have everything under one consolidated campaign. You know, ramp up 14 days through the learning period with that one campaign,  apply the incrementality test and like kind of get those initial learnings that we're after. After we go from there, then we can start looking at, okay,  is this a client with a larger range of AOVs? What's the AOV of the current universal campaign that we have? Do we want to segment out additional campaigns to make sure that we're driving spend to higher AOV products? That's something we're experimenting with right now.

**Speaker 3:**
[(16:49)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1009)
So this is a question I don't know the answer to. Is the bidding set at the campaign level only or is there an opportunity to set bid at the ad set level?

**Speaker 1:**
[(16:59)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1019)
That's correct. Right now, it's only at the campaign level.

**Speaker 3:**
[(17:02)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1022)
Okay, so this goes to my age-old Tonyism about why to segment. So, the answer for why to segment is because you need a different setting. So, to your point about the AOV thing or whether it's marginal profile or whatever else,  I think this is going to be this continued thing. Every advertising channel we go into, the reason we would have to segment is because we need a different bid. If that's set at the campaign level, then it makes sense that AOV would be the trigger. What else stands out to you about structure that feels interesting or novel?

**Speaker 1:**
[(17:43)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1063)
To touch on that is that with the AOV, with the AOV, you know,  like on Google previously or other platforms, you know, if we have a consolidated campaign,  the algorithm may, what's the word I'm looking for, like favor the highest converting products essentially,  and then push spend towards those products. So then you're having all the lower AOV items get the spend. So, you know, not, I think AppLovin so far is doing a decent job of distribution across like the AOVs. But definitely like speaking to the reps, you know, we're testing out having other campaigns to drive spend towards.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(18:18)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1098)
This is just a layman's question, just because I didn't, I don't think I heard you guys mention this. But obviously, like the reason I'm meta that we would do segmentation by AOV has to do with cost controls. Is there anything like how, what's the situation with that on AppLovin? Yeah, yeah, they only do, they only do cost controls.

**Speaker 3:**
[(18:35)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1115)
Okay, so they started with, yeah, that's it. So this like goes back, this goes back to that sort of other point that I made earlier about how when they built the platform,  they sort of built it with like the best of, you know, controls.

**Tony:**
[(18:48)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1128)
So they started, initially it was only cost per purchase.

**Speaker 3:**
[(18:50)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1130)
That was the only bidding. And then halfway through last year, they gave us ROAS bidding, but both like efficiency-based bidding options.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(19:00)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1140)
Interesting. The element of it being sort of like at a certain point, I mean,  this must have been in the 90s or whatever,  every new car all of a sudden had power steering and power windows or something like that. And it's sort of because it's a newer platform and there's not a lot of those,  or at least at this scale, it has all of the bells and whistles. That have been developed previously.

**Tony:**
[(19:17)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1157)
You might almost say it the other way.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(19:19)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1159)
Or it takes away.

**Speaker 3:**
[(19:20)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1160)
That's right.

**Tony:**
[(19:21)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1161)
Yeah, which is I think like a really interesting. It'll be really interesting to watch the trajectory of the platform because they,  the story I make up is they started with this really tight vision.

**Speaker 3:**
[(19:33)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1173)
We're going to use zero day click attribution only.

**Tony:**
[(19:37)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1177)
We're going to do cost per purchase optimization goal only. And then, like, you hear me and Connor sort of, like, talking about, like,  all of the reasons why the settings, like, are important. Like, oh, can we set the bid at the ad set level? Or, like...

**Speaker 3:**
[(19:52)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1192)
What was another one that came up, Conor, and you and I were talking about it?

**Tony:**
[(19:55)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1195)
It was, oh, the scheduling. Like, because we had some creative that we wanted to start and stop at the ad set level around a sale. And we were like, because it was over the holiday, I was helping you with it.

**Speaker 3:**
[(20:07)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1207)
You know.

**Speaker 1:**
[(20:09)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1209)
Yeah.

**Tony:**
[(20:09)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1209)
And so we asked our partners over at the platform, like, hey, can we do this?

**Speaker 3:**
[(20:14)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1214)
And they're like, no, we'll add it to the feature list.

**Tony:**
[(20:16)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1216)
So it's like, there's like this tension, you know, they built this really simple thing. And then all of us advertisers come in and like, hey, can we do this?

**Unknown Speaker:**
[(20:23)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1223)
Can we do that?

**Tony:**
[(20:24)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1224)
Can we do the other thing? See how long it takes us to screw it all up with our desires.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(20:30)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1230)
All right. Well, let's keep rolling on through here. So we're talking campaign structure. Actually, is there anything else? Well, yeah.

**Tony:**
[(20:36)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1236)
So you're at structure, like campaign level.

**Speaker 3:**
[(20:39)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1239)
I'd be curious if you just go one level deeper, kind of like how are you thinking about ad sets?

**Speaker 1:**
[(20:44)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1244)
Yeah. Yeah, totally. And like the creative set level, like We're testing a lot out right now by product. So we'll get creative in whether it's images or videos on new product drops. So then we'll have a creative set for that product drop. And for each creative set, we're allowed 10 videos, 10 images. So we're uploading as many as we can. Let's say we have 10 videos, 10 images. And then, you know,  kind of AppLovin system algorithm is figuring out which combination of those is working the best and then showing that those more consistently.

**Tony:**
[(21:20)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1280)
Standard practice basically.

**Speaker 3:**
[(21:23)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1283)
I guess maybe I was gonna say standard practice and then I was about to say like feed it as much creative as possible but I'm actually hearing sort of something a little bit different like there's a limit,  a 10 image, 10 video limit for each creative set.

**Speaker 1:**
[(21:39)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1299)
One more thing on that creative just like a little fun fact about AppLovin is that It has a median exposure of ad creative videos of 35 seconds,  which is longer than like most other ad platforms, right? So that a minimum of 10 seconds watch time guaranteed every ad.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(22:03)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1323)
Okay,  so well that then kind of begs the question of like how has that affected the types of creative you've seen work? I mean you mentioned before like man-on-the-street interviews, so you're testing everything,  but is there a type of creative product that's more conducive to this platform that you've seen so far?

**Speaker 1:**
[(22:17)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1337)
I think still trying to like look into those details,  but one thing right now about that is that,  you know, if we can get 9 by 16 videos that are longer, you know,  like they're in that 40 second to a minute range,  okay, then we can actually utilize that fun fact and try to get that median exposure of 35 seconds.

**Speaker 3:**
[(22:40)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1360)
Yeah,  I think I think that's like the I think that's gonna be like the biggest piece of creative strategy for the channel for that we can just think about going forward the fact that the exposure is There's no way to click out of it. It's like there's no benefit at all to not using 30 plus second videos.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(23:01)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1381)
And let me just say, just in case anyone's tuning in on this for the first time,  AppLovin is serving you ads within mobile games, right? I'm sure everybody knows that at this point,  but just to like get the visual back in our minds of you're playing Majula or whatever,  A 30-second ad pops up. You can't skip. You have to watch it in order to get the next free level or whatever.

**Speaker 3:**
[(23:19)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1399)
A little fun fact. The AppLovin folks built an app. I think it's a solitary game.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(23:24)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1404)
Oh, no way.

**Speaker 3:**
[(23:25)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1405)
And you can use it to trigger their ad inventory, and it's kind of fun.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(23:28)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1408)
Oh, cool.

**Speaker 3:**
[(23:28)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1408)
So we'll get a link that we can share out on the podcast here just so if you want to experience it,  feel what an ad looks like, you can download this app. And it serves live ads. You can get actual impressions out of it.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(23:41)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1421)
What's the minimum watch time, like you have to watch? Do you know?

**Speaker 1:**
[(23:45)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1425)
Ten seconds.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(23:46)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1426)
Ten seconds, okay. The thought, like, to your point a little earlier, Tony,  was that with a ten second window in which you are sort of guaranteed eyeballs,  more or less, you have opportunities to hook You know,  we always say the first three seconds on that or whatever. Now you have the first 10 seconds to give yourself sort of more chances at making that hook land. So maybe on one ad, you didn't really get it in the first three seconds. You accidentally put the hook in the next three seconds or something like that. You know, how we kind of take scenes and rearrange them.

[(24:18)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1458)
You have the opportunity for maybe the hook to land later and thereby sort of increase your chances of getting high performing ad.

**Speaker 3:**
[(24:26)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1466)
Yeah, I mean,  I think there's going to be all sorts of cool stuff that we're going to try and our people are going to try and upload. If you think about like how media is consumed on scrolly social media, Bro, people are scrolling. So you, I mean, you have very little opportunity to catch somebody's attention. And so, yeah, I think, I think this is just like a, it's a little bit,  it's a little bit more of a canvas to work with. I think that's gonna represent an opportunity for people to get really creative about how they use that space.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(25:01)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1501)
Okay, any other sort of creative observations that you've had so far?

**Speaker 1:**
[(25:05)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1505)
I think that about wraps it up for now, at least off the top of my head.

**Tony:**
[(25:11)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1511)
Let's talk about the bidding stuff. So I mentioned they started with cost per purchase as the primary mechanism or bidding optimization.

**Speaker 3:**
[(25:19)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1519)
They gave us ROAS bidding sometime last year and then most recently they introduced a new customer acquisition type of bidding. I'd be curious to hear how you're thinking about those different things and how they're playing out practically in the accounts.

**Speaker 1:**
[(25:38)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1538)
Yeah, for sure. Definitely running a mixture of like universal versus prospecting. Those are their two different campaign types. So universal campaigns, including existing customers, as well as prospecting and then prospecting campaigns, just prospecting. So I've been kind of trying to figure out, okay,  like what percentage split or like find out more information about the universal campaigns as new versus returning. Kind of still, you know, figuring out more info on that. But in terms of bidding, you know, the approach that I've been taking is so,  you know, I'm taking our client's AMER target,  and then I'm applying the average incrementality factor that we have of 151%.

[(26:21)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1581)
You know, then I'm getting a platform for me to set in AppLovin,  and then I'm pushing as much spend to that as possible.

**Speaker 3:**
[(26:29)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1589)
What are you noticing on the differences in delivery or performance, not like good or bad,  but just like stability potentially or like scale potential between cost per purchase bidding and ROAS biddings or anything that stands out?

**Speaker 1:**
[(26:46)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1606)
Nothing that I've noticed right now. I've been testing out both and kind of leaning towards the Target ROAS bidding. I think I've seen a little bit more efficiency and scale from that. I definitely got to get back over to Cost Per Purchase and probably test it out a little bit more as the platform evolves and gets better. But right now, leaning towards the Target ROAS.

**Tony:**
[(27:08)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1628)
I've had one experience using the prospecting campaign and we actually had Northbeam in this situation.

**Speaker 3:**
[(27:15)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1635)
So Northbeam is pretty cool.

**Tony:**
[(27:17)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1637)
One of the cool things about Northbeam is they pixel the site and they develop a metric for all the traffic from all the channels that's new customer percentage. And it's pretty useful actually. So in this particular experience, we got to demo the prospecting, the new customer acquisition.

**Speaker 3:**
[(27:37)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1657)
...function in AppLovin, and we saw like a 3x increase in the North Beam percent new customer traffic. So it's a pretty good signal that that optimization goal is leading to the outcome that we're after,  which is net new eyeballs for sure. The new customer percentage in Northbeam for this particular account was already in a pretty good spot,  but this setting actually helped to push it even further.

**Tony:**
[(28:07)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1687)
That one was an interesting one as well because it's a larger client that had a pretty significant customer file,  and I think for Just like with all of our brands that we work with,  if you're a big business that has hundreds of thousands or however many people in your customer file,  you have to be even more thoughtful about what's happening in your media accounts versus a newer brand that doesn't have a large customer file.

**Speaker 3:**
[(28:30)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1710)
There's less concern for that there.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(28:36)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1716)
So is the effectiveness of that new customer percentage optimization or whatever? You feel like that's due to the richer data set from the pixel? Like, is this something that feels unique to Apple and like its ability to do this? Or is it just you're just saying like, they're able to do it?

**Tony:**
[(28:51)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1731)
Yeah, no, the latter, I think able to do it. Well, you know, I think the idea of like.

**Speaker 3:**
[(29:00)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1740)
The media platforms, whatever media platform you're talking about,  being able to reach net new people is something that we always are working to dial in and tighten up.

**Tony:**
[(29:14)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1754)
There's sort of a connection to how we, for most of our media stack, how we do bidding.

**Speaker 3:**
[(29:22)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1762)
So we use conversion optimization across media channels like 95% of the time,  with the exception of some brand media stuff where we're using like CPM or CPB or whatever bidding.

**Tony:**
[(29:33)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1773)
So anyway, the point being is like, The media platforms are getting a signal from us,  very strong signal, not a mixed signal at all, like, hey, give us conversions. And then people that have interacted with the brand in some way, shape, or form,  whether they're an existing, whether they purchased at some time in the past,  or remarketing because they've been to the site,  have a higher propensity to convert.

**Speaker 3:**
[(29:51)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1791)
So there's this tension in everything that we do,  or we are trying to reach new eyeballs,  but we also have these efficiency goals and The answer to your question succinctly,  Richard, is that the AppLovin folks are aware of what's important to us as performance marketers. They're giving us tools that appear to be effective in helping us walk that line.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(30:11)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1811)
Anything else you guys want to hit on bidding segmentation?

**Speaker 1:**
[(30:14)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1814)
One more thing to add, correct me if I'm wrong, Tony,  but I think that a lot of our incrementality tests so far,  like averaging out to that 151%, are using the universal campaign. So we have a new client that is running prospecting only from the start,  running an incrementality test, don't have the read on that yet. But it'll be interesting to kind of look back on and say, okay, what is the difference between these reads,  right? Expecting, you know, that prospecting campaign to be higher.

**Speaker 3:**
[(30:50)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1850)
We'll make a gentleman's bet right now.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(30:54)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1854)
So what's your side of the bet?

**Speaker 3:**
[(30:59)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1859)
Me and Conor are both on the side that the prospecting bidding is going to have an incrementality readout that's higher than the ones we've done so far.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(31:08)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1868)
I don't like my odds, I'll just say that. All right, well, so speaking of placing bets on the future,  let's talk about what we feel like is coming up next. So I know, Tony, you have some predictions maybe for where AppLovin is going to go in the next little bit,  but talk us through some of that.

**Speaker 3:**
[(31:23)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1883)
Yeah, I mean,  there's no doubt in my mind that we're going to see material like orders of magnitude investment into this channel for our clients in 2026.  On Black Friday, Cyber Monday, the holiday, like it It was really fascinating to watch this investment. So a couple of things. Number one,  it turned out to be the third largest investment out of all the channels that we run for our clients over that period,  which is wild that the new kid on the block popped up into the third spot.

**Tony:**
[(31:55)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1915)
Number two, the curve of the investment bucked the trend.

**Speaker 3:**
[(32:00)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1920)
Black Friday, Cyber Monday sort of always follows this pretty normal pattern where the investment Friday is the largest,  the weekend comes down a little bit, and then Monday comes back up. But it's not as high as Friday. So the AppLovin trend was not the peak on Friday. Levels on Friday, down a little bit on Monday, Tuesday. The peak was actually on Monday.

**Tony:**
[(32:24)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1944)
And the indication, like the reason why is because number one,  we can deploy a lot of media dollars really fast because there's so many impressions available. And number two, it's performant.

**Speaker 3:**
[(32:36)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1956)
So the media dollars actually flowed into AppLovin towards the end of that period, which is an incredible signal.

**Tony:**
[(32:42)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1962)
So my prediction, one last point on Black Friday.

**Speaker 3:**
[(32:48)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1968)
Third largest investment channel, but still a relatively small portion of the whole for the weekend, a little less than 5%.

**Tony:**
[(32:56)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1976)
But my prediction for this coming year, in 2026, is that AppLovin is going to be.

**Speaker 3:**
[(33:04)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=1984)
15%, 20% of the total investment in Black Friday and Cyber Monday. I wouldn't be surprised if we look back on this year and App 11 proves to be a material percentage of our total e-investment across our whole stack,  which would be a real It would really be something,  because forever we've had meta and Google Ads represent the vast majority of where we invest the dollars. There's some exploration into other channels, and YouTube's been growing as well.

**Tony:**
[(33:38)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2018)
But if I could comment on that, YouTube has been tougher to measure.

**Speaker 3:**
[(33:43)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2023)
The incrementality bans are wider. It makes for more uncertainty. The money did not flow like that on Black Friday, Cyber Monday.

**Tony:**
[(33:51)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2031)
Prediction,  it's going to be a good year for AppLovin or Axon and for all of our clients that we get to go explore.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(33:58)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2038)
So get on board. I remember, you know, when this conversation first started more than a year ago,  October 2024, the initial conversation was like, what if this could be the third cliff? And some of our, as these sort of incrementality tests went through,  that sort of just seemed to be coming to fruition. And I think what you're saying here is like, that's happening, basically. AppLovin is the third platform now, and so it's time to get on that.

**Speaker 3:**
[(34:26)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2066)
I mean, if you were asking me, like, if I'm running my own e-com brand,  and I feel like, you know, you should have never done with Meta.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(34:36)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2076)
I'm not sure.

**Tony:**
[(34:37)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2077)
But I feel like I had that resourced correctly.

**Speaker 3:**
[(34:40)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2080)
When I say resource correctly, I mean the correct amount of creative production for the necessary volume to continue to scale and meet my goals. I felt pretty good about where I was at on the Google Ads platform. I was starting to explore in YouTube. My third bet would absolutely be on AppLovin. If I was running an e-commerce brand, I would say to myself,  how am I going to make this 20% of my media investment this year?

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(35:04)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2104)
I will not be on the other side of that bet. I'll be on your side of that one. All right, folks. Well, I think that's going to do it for us.

**Speaker 1:**
[(35:10)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2110)
Conor, anything else you want to add about any thoughts for 2026? No, I mean,  I think the only thing I'll say is with the available impression share, with the incrementality results,  we got to be pushing the spend here.

**Richard Gaffin:**
[(35:27)](https://podwise.ai/dashboard/episodes/6838716?locate=2127)
